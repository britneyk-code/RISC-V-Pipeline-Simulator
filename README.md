# RISC-V-Pipeline-Simulator
The project involves building a functional simulation of a 5-stage RISC-V pipeline (Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, Write-back) to perform architectural workload analysis and understand the impact of different hardware configurations on system performance. The simulator is being developed using Ripes and C++ to model the RV32I Instruction Set Architecture (ISA).
